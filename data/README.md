# JLPT N5 grammar inventory

`jlpt-n5-grammar.json` is the canonical preliminary curriculum for the app. It
is deliberately a flat array: categories are labels on entries, not nested
sections. Stable `id` values can later key lessons, exercises, and user progress.

Each entry contains only scalar fields:

- `category`: a filterable curriculum area.
- `kind`: concept, form, particle, pattern, expression, structure, or system.
- `pattern`: the Japanese form or an abstract formation.
- `name`: a concise English label.
- `meaning`: the learning objective.
- `scope`: `foundation`, `core`, or `boundary`.

There is no official itemized JLPT grammar syllabus. This inventory synthesizes
the shared conversation with the official JLPT N5 test-item descriptions and
the N5 curricula published by Bunpro, JLPT Sensei, and Yatta. `boundary` keeps
useful points that sources variously place at N5 or N4 without presenting them
as undisputed N5 requirements.

Writing systems, vocabulary, and kanji are excluded because this file is the
grammar curriculum. Grammar-dependent counting, time, and question systems are
included.
